**AFID: A Public Fabric Image Database for Defect Detection** is a dataset for an instance segmentation task. It is used in the textile industry, and in the surface defect detection domain. 

The dataset consists of 247 images with 117 labeled objects belonging to 12 different classes including *fuzzyball*, *nep*, *broken end*, and other: *broken pick*, *cut selvage*, *broken yarn*, *crease*, *warp ball*, *weft curling*, *knots*, *contamination*, and *weft crack*.

Images in the AFID dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. There are 145 (59% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2019 by the Universitat Politècnica de València, Spain and AITEX, Spain.
